			What are metaballs?
		</h1>
		<p>
			As defined by Wikipedia "metaballs are organic-looking n-dimensional isosurfaces, characterized by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, contiguous objects." So what does this mean? It basically means that metaballs are objects that can 'blob' together to form a new 'gloopy' object. These so-called metaballs interested me ever since I stumbled across then on a YouTube page called 'The Coding Train.' He made a version of metaballs using different colors by loading calculating and updating pixels every frame. While this had a very interesting effect the process of looping through every pixel is strenious for most computers hardware and can't really be scaled up to much without better optimizations.
